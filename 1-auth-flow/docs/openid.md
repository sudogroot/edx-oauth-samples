## What is openId ? 

 * OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an authentication protocol, based on the OAuth 2.0 family of specifications. It uses simple JSON Web Tokens (JWT) , which you can obtain using flows conforming to the OAuth 2.0 specifications. While OAuth 2.0 is about resource access and sharing, OIDC is all about user authentication.(source https://auth0.com/docs/protocols/oidc)ce 

 In other words openId is a thin layer on top OAuth 2.0
